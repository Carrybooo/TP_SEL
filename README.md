# TP_SEL

This is the git repo for my lab work (TP = Travaux Pratiques in french) of SEL (Syst√®me d'Exploitation Linux = Linux Operating System in french)

The tracer program is "tpsel" and the traced program is "tpsel_trace"

To launch the programs, open 2 terminals, one into each program directory, and run : "cargo run"

***CAUTION*** be sure to launch the traced program before the tracer because the tracer needs it to run correctly.

The instructions for this work are in Sujet_TP.pdf (in french only)

The test.c is just a program to test C commands and values, useless for the Rust part.
