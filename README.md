# TP_SEL

This is the git repo for my lab work (TP = Travaux Pratiques in french) of SEL (Syst√®me d'Exploitation Linux = Linux Operating System in french)

The tracer program is "tpsel" and the traced program is "tpsel_trace"

The instructions for this work are in Sujet_TP.pdf

The test.c is just a program to test C commands and values, useless for the Rust part.
