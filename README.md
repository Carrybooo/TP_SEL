## TP_SEL

This is the git repo for my lab work (TP = Travaux Pratiques in french) of SEL (Syst√®me d'Exploitation Linux = Linux Operating System in french)

The instructions for this work are in Sujet_TP.pdf (in french only)

The tracer program is "tpsel" and the traced program is "tpsel_trace"

To launch the programs, open 2 terminals, one into each program directory, and run : "cargo run"

***Warning*** : be sure to launch the traced program before the tracer because the tracer needs it to run correctly.

***Warning*** the usage of *mprotect* can lead to SELinux errors ! Be sure to fix it if you want the program to work correctly.

*Current advancement* : I've almost finished challenge 4 :sunglasses: (i still have no solution to come back to the previous function after putting the trampoline in place).
